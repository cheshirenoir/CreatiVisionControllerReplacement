# CreatiVisionControllerReplacement

A bunch of PCBs designed to allow you to replace your failing CreatiVision controller membranes
The 4 sections are designed to be joined with short lengths of patch wire (ribbon cable).
See https://ilike8bits.com/total-joystick-madness/ for a build guide.

Notes: Use 0.6mm PCBs when yuou order. You'll need 3 different PCBs.
